### Provide answers to the following questions for each set of partners.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 1 hour
  - Task 2 (Writing the Python-C interface): 2 hours
  - Task 3 (Speeding up matrix operations): 6 hours
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>It was a new topic of cs that I had never worked with before so it was definitely interesting. The most
       interesting part was definitely learning to program in ways that are super relevant to actual industry work
       like threading.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned how difficult of a process it can be to achieve high performance. There is a lot of restarting required
       to achieve the most optimal solution and that can definitely be infuriating. I also learned that the first solution
       is almost always the worst one and can always be improved.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b> I wish the autograder tokens were higher since the hive machine speeds were not the same as the AG speeds. Its not like 
       knowing the speed of your code would have helped fix your code. Relying on the AG was necessary for this project so more tokens
       would have been better. Also would have appreciated a little more emphasis in lab on cache blocking.</b>

### If you worked with a partner:
- In one short paragraph, describe your contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>I implemented the initial matrix functions, helped with writing the python-c interface and enhanced the performance of the matrix functions.</b>
- In one short paragraph, describe your partner's contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>He also helped write the python-c interface, wrote all the tests, and helped with the enhancements.</b>
